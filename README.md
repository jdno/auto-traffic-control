**Auto Traffic Control** is a video game played by programming. The player's
task is to create a program that can safely manage the airspace above two
airports.

The game is designed to provide an open-ended sandbox that players can use to
freely practice programming. It provides a language-agnostic [gRPC] API, giving
players free choice of programming language or paradigm.

Check out the official [Getting Started](https://auto-traffic-control.com/docs)
guide to start playing the game.
