# pre-commit configuration
#
# We use pre-commit to enforce a consistency in our repositories. By default,
# YAML and Markdown files get linted, and Prettier runs to auto-format the file
# types it supports. Depending on the project, other rules can be added here to
# support the needs of the project.
#
# See https://pre-commit.com for more information
# See https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks
