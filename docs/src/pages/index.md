# Auto Traffic Control

![screenshot](/img/screenshot.png)

**Auto Traffic Control** is a video game for programmers. Your task is to create
a program that can safely manage the airspace above two airports. Score points
by landing airplanes, and make sure no aircraft get too close together!

The game is designed to provide an open-ended sandbox that players can use to
freely practice programming. The game provides a language-agnostic
[gRPC] API, giving players free choice of programming language or paradigm.
