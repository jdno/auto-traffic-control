# Auto Traffic Control

![screenshot](/img/screenshot.png)

**Auto Traffic Control** is a video game played by programming. Your task is to
create a program that can safely manage the airspace above two airports. Score
points by landing airplanes, and make sure no aircraft get too close together!

The game is designed to provide an open-ended sandbox that players can use to
freely practice programming. The game provides a language-agnostic
[gRPC] API, giving players free choice of programming language or paradigm.

## Project Status

**Auto Traffic Control** is currently in an early prototyping phase.

The game can already be played, but many game mechanics and features are still
missing. You will also encounter the occasional bug, which you can
[report on GitHub][issues].

During prototyping, the project does not follow [semantic versioning][semver].
The API might change from one minor version to the next (e.g. from `0.1.0` to
`0.2.0`). Check the [release notes][releases] to learn about breaking changes in
a release.
