# Introduction

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Once again, we're super happy that you're interested in our game.

This [tutorial](/docs/tutorial) guides you through the process of installing and
playing the game. We will download the game from [itch.io], create a new bot
using [TypeScript], set up and configure the API client, and then start playing
the game.

The code used in this tutorial is available on [GitHub][repository]. You can
either follow along as we create our own project, or clone the template
repository to bootstrap your Node bot.

Use the links at the bottom of the page to read through the tutorial, or jump
around using the sidebar on the left. You can always go back and re-read a
section if you want to. If anything is unclear, feel free to
[open an issue][issues] on GitHub to let us know.

Now, let's get started by downloading the game from [itch.io]! Go to the next
section by clicking "Next" down below.
