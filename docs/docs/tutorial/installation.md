# Installing the Game

The first step towards playing **Auto Traffic Control** is installing the game
itself. There are three different ways to do this, but we strongly recommend
the first:

1. Download and run the game through the [itch.io app]
2. Download a pre-compiled executable from [itch.io]
3. Compile the game yourself

The tutorial will use the first method to get the game. The second is easy to do
by accident when browsing [itch.io] in the browser. And the third method is only
useful if you want to play the very latest development version of the game.

## Getting the itch app

There are many benefits to using the **itch** app to play **Auto Traffic
Control**. To quote itch's website:

> The itch.io app, **itch**, lets you effortlessly download and run games and
> software from itch.io. All of your downloads are kept in a single place and
> are automatically updated.

Most importantly for the purpose of **Auto Traffic Control**, you don't need to
worry about manually installing the game and keeping it up-to-date. That's all
done through the **itch** app.

Go to the following website, download the installer for the **itch** app, and
then follow the [instructions](https://itch.io/docs/itch/installing/)
to install it on your machine:

<https://itch.io/app>

## Installing the game

After you've installed the **itch** app, go ahead and open it. You should see a
screen similar to the one below:

Click the navigation bar at the top of the screen, which in the screenshot above
is showing `https://itch.io`, and copy & paste the following URL into it:

<https://jdno.itch.io/auto-traffic-control>

Hit `Enter`, and you'll see the page for **Auto Traffic Control**. It'll look
something like this:

Click the `Install` button in the lower right corner of the screen, and confirm
the default settings for the installation by clicking `Install` in the pop-up
that has opened. **itch** will now download the game.

## Launching the game

Once the game is ready, the `Install` button will be replaced by a `Launch`
button. When you click that button, the game will be started and you'll see its
starting screen.

You can close the game for now by closing its window. `cmd + q` on macOS or
`alt + f4` on Windows will close the game as well.
