**Auto Traffic Control** is a video game played by programming. The player's
task is to create a program that can safely manage the airspace above two
airports.

The game is designed to provide an open-ended sandbox that players can use to
freely practice programming. The game provides a language-agnostic gRPC API,
giving players free choice of programming language or paradigm.

This project generates the Java SDK for the game's gRPC API.

## Usage

This SDK utilizes gradle - v7.0 or later - to drive the protobuf compiler.

```shell
cd sdk/java
gradle clean build publishToMavenLocal
```

You can now add `auto-traffic-control` as a dependency in Gradle...

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

```groovy
// gradle terse
implementation 'com.auto-traffic-control:auto-traffic-control:0.3.2'

// gradle verbose
implementation group: 'com.auto-traffic-control' name : 'auto-traffic-control' version: '0.3.2'
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

...or Maven.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>
        com.auto-traffic-control
    </groupId>
    <artifactId>
        auto-traffic-control
    </artifactId>
    <version>
        0.3.2
    </version>
</dependency>
```
